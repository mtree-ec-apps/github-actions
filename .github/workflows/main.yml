  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Step 1- log the pre-build disc spave
        run: df
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Step 2- checkout the main github branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Step 3- Run a one-line script

      - name: Step 4- Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo nothing to see in this multi-line script.
